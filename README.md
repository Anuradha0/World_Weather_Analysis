#### World_Weather_Analysis  

## Overview 
The goal of this project was to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Moreover, I used the Google Maps API to come up with one hotel recommendation for each city. And lastly, I created a travel itinerary map where I chose 4 neighboor cities to come up with a full travel and directions guide.

The code retrieved weather data of many cities around the World. A map was created will all these cities displaying their location, country and current weather description. In addition to the city weather data gathered. I used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences. With this filtered dataframe of cities I found the nearest hotel using Google Maps API to serve as a travel recommendation to our customers.

A Trip has been designed for our customers with an itinerary and driving directions to all four cities.
